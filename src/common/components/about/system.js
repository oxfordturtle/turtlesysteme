  <h3>Turtle System E</h3>
  <p>The <i>Electron Turtle System</i>, or <i>Turtle System E</i>, is a multi-platform educational programming environment written in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> and <a href="https://electronjs.org/">Electron</a>. It is available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux, and can also be run directly in a web browser.</p>
  <p>The application is open source, and the source code can be viewed at <a href="https://github.com/oxfordturtle/turtlesysteme">https://github.com/oxfordturtle/turtlesysteme</a>.</p>
  <p>This version is developed in tandem with the original <i>Delphi Turtle System</i>, or <i>Turtle System D</i>, which is written in <a href="https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi">Delphi</a>, and is available for download as a Windows desktop application. Windows users may prefer to use that version, since it is more powerful in some respects, and is faster at compiling and running very long or complicated programs.</p>`
